## Generate an application

Run `yarn nx g @nrwl/angular:app my-app` to generate an application.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `yarn nx g @nrwl/angular:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

Libraries are sharable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@vacgaps/mylib`.

## Development server

Run `yarn nx serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `yarn nx g @nrwl/angular:component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

## Build

Run `yarn nx build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `yarn nx test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `yarn nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).
